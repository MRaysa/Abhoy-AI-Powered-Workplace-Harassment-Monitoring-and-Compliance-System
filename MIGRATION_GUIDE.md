## API Integration

The project now has a structured API service layer in `src/services/api.js`:

```javascript
import { reportAPI, userAPI, analyticsAPI } from "../services/api";

// Example: Creating a report
const newReport = await reportAPI.create({
  incidentType: "Harassment",
  description: "...",
  // ... other fields
});

// Example: Getting user reports
const reports = await reportAPI.getUserReports(userId);

// Example: Updating user info
await userAPI.update(userId, { displayName: "New Name" });
```

## Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Setup**: Connect to your backend API
2. **Firebase Config**: Ensure Firebase credentials are set
3. **AI Integration**: Implement AI-powered report analysis
4. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket/Firebase Realtime for live updates
5. **Charting**: Integrate Chart.js or Recharts for analytics
6. **Email Notifications**: Set up email service
7. **File Upload**: Implement evidence/attachment upload
8. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Important**: If you were using the old file locations:

1. Update all imports from `src/components/SignIn.jsx` to `src/pages/Auth/Login.jsx`
2. Update all imports from `src/components/SignUp.jsx` to `src/pages/Auth/Signup.jsx`
3. The main router structure has changed - check `src/routes/router.jsx`

## Build Status

✅ Project builds successfully with no errors
